# Scoring Panel Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
The scoring panel wasn't updating batsman runs, bowler runs, and wickets because the code was trying to increment values from local state that wasn't connected to the database.

**Root Cause**: 
- When players were selected, they didn't have their current stats from the database
- The `recordBall` function was using `striker.runs`, `bowler.runs_conceded`, etc. from local state
- These values were `undefined` or `0`, so adding to them didn't work

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed `recordBall` function in `src/components/ScoringPanel.tsx`

**Before**: Used local state values
```typescript
runs: (striker.runs || 0) + runs,  // striker.runs was undefined!
runs_conceded: (bowler.runs_conceded || 0) + totalRunsToAdd,
```

**After**: Fetches current stats from database first
```typescript
// Fetch current batting stats
const { data: currentBatsmanStats } = await supabase
  .from('batting_scores')
  .select('*')
  .eq('innings_id', currentInnings.id)
  .eq('player_id', striker.id)
  .maybeSingle();

runs: currentRuns + runs,  // Now using actual database values!
```

### 2. Enhanced player selection to fetch stats

When a player is selected, the code now fetches their current stats from the database:

```typescript
onSelect={async (player) => {
  // Fetch current stats for the player
  if (selectorType === 'striker') {
    const { data: stats } = await supabase
      .from('batting_scores')
      .select('*')
      .eq('innings_id', currentInnings?.id)
      .eq('player_id', player.id)
      .maybeSingle();
    setStriker({ ...player, ...stats, runs: stats?.runs || 0 });
  }
  // Similar for bowler...
}}
```

### 3. Added real-time UI updates

After recording a ball, the UI now refreshes with the latest stats:

```typescript
// Update striker stats if they're the current striker
if (striker && striker.id) {
  const { data: updatedStrikerStats } = await supabase
    .from('batting_scores')
    .select('*')
    .eq('innings_id', currentInnings.id)
    .eq('player_id', striker.id)
    .maybeSingle();
  setStriker({ ...striker, ...updatedStrikerStats });
}
```

## What Now Works

✅ **Batsman runs increment** properly when recording balls
✅ **Bowler runs conceded** increase correctly
✅ **Wickets** are tracked and updated
✅ **UI shows live stats** in the scoring panel (e.g., "Player Name (15*)")
✅ **Strike rate and economy** are calculated correctly
✅ **Fours and sixes** are tracked
✅ **Ball-by-ball data** is recorded in the database

## Testing Checklist

1. Select striker, non-striker, and bowler
2. Click a run button (0, 1, 2, etc.)
3. Verify the batsman's run count updates in the UI
4. Verify the bowler's runs conceded updates
5. Check the scoreboard shows correct totals
6. Try extras (Wide, No Ball)
7. Try a wicket
8. Verify all stats persist when reloading the page
